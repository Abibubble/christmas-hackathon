                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                    Chinese New Year is a 15 day celebration starting on the day of the new moon
                                    that occurs between 21st January and 20th February. Some celebrations include
                                    the eve before this, turning it to a 16 day celebration. Further-more, some
                                    families will begin the festivities with the Laba Festival, creating a 40 day
                                    festive period!
                                </p>
                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                    Tales say the Jade Emperor held a race between many animals to enter the
                                    heavenly gate. As with all ancient stories, there are many variations told of
                                    why and how this occurred. One thing remains consistent throughout, the order in
                                    which the animals arrived: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig. 
                                    The actual year of the race is disputed and so is the date when the celebrations
                                    began.
                                </p>
                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                    The rat used its cunning ways to win the race and had already ensured one animal
                                    would not be successful. The cat and the rat were close neighbors, but the rat
                                    was tired of the cat's bullying ways. When the race was announced the rat took
                                    an opportunity to scupper the cat's chances. As the cat was a sleepy animal, it
                                    had asked the rat to wake it on the day of the race. Instead, the rat snuck away
                                    quietly leaving the cat asleep and so, the cat slept through the entire race.

                                <h3>History Of The Holiday...</h3>
                                <h4>Origin Early in Shang Dynasty (17th century BC - 1046 BC)</h4>
                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                    Ancient people concluded the cycles of seasons from their planting experience, and the yearly celebration came about with the creation of the calendar in the Shang Dynasty. The earliest worshiping activities became the birth of the festival. People attributed their food, clothes and harvest to the god and ancestor's will, so ceremonies were held to pray for blessings and peace at the end of each year.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Use of 'Year' in Zhou Dynasty (1046 - 256 BC)</h4>
                                <p class="holiday-decription holiday-p">
                                    The name of 'Year', 'Nian' in Chinese, emerged in the Zhou Dynasty. Ancient worship activities turned into social practice to observe the beginning of farming work in spring. Not only worshiping the ancestors and praying for a good harvest, people also began to enshrine many other gods at the same time.</p>
                                <h4>Date Fixed since Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD)</h4>
                                <p class="holiday-decription holiday-p">
                                    The festival date was decided by the Emperor Wudi, of Han Dynasty. It was set as the first month in Chinese lunar calendar, which was of great significance in Chinese New Year history. The date has been used for thousands of years till now. At that time, the festival had become a nationwide event. There was a big carnival launched by the government, and civil servants gathered for celebrations. New activities took place such as staying through the night, burning bamboo; which is just like setting off fireworks nowadays, as well as hanging peach boards; which later became the Spring Festival couplets.</p>
                                <h4>Celebration Style from Wei & Jin to Qing Dynasty (220 - 1911 AD)</h4>
                                <p class="holiday-decription holiday-p">
                                    The celebrations remained a grand fair for the government and common people continued to use the cracking sound of burning bamboo to subdue the evil spirits. Staying up was a tradition that was also widely kept, and people would dress up smart to kneel down to senior family members. The words Yuandan and Xinnian were created to mark the turn between two years.</p>

                                    In the flourishing Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD), the function of Chinese New Year had shifted from worshiping and praying to social entertainment. Public holidays were granted to allow people to stay with family members. At that time, it evolved into a festival for common people to share in the celebrations and rejoice. The invention of black powder in the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 AD) brought firecrackers into the celebration.</p>

                                Originally known as 'Christ's Mass', Christmas is the most well-known holiday in over 160 countries worldwide (over 80% of the world).
                            </p>

                                The first recorded 'Christmas Day' was in Rome in 336AD. Traditionally, Christians claim Christmas day as the day that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born. The exact date of this is not known as 100% fact, but December 25 is largely attributed to the first Christian historian, Sextus Julius Africanus, in around 221 A.D.
                            </p>
                            <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                By the Middle Ages, Europeans created some of the Christmas customs we recognize
                                today. In Strasbourg, apple-decorated fir trees appeared in homes. During the
                                17th and 18th centuries, people started to give gifts as symbolic of the Magi
                                arriving in Bethlehem with offerings for the newborn baby Jesus. By the 19th
                                century, fir wreaths laden with 24 candles representing the 24 days before
                                Christmas were later reduced to a much safer four candles. Eventually, Christmas
                                Day traditions spread beyond Europe to the rest of the world.

                                Christmas celebrations around the world can vary greatly in Christmas traditions
                                for many countries involve setting up a Christmas tree with lights, hanging
                                Advent wreaths and stockings, candy canes, and setting out cookies and milk.
                                Churches and families set up nativity scenes depicting the birth of Jesus
                                Christ. Families also send out Christmas cards, exchange gifts, and prepare a
                                Christmas feast to share with their family or their extended families.

                                The Christmas season is a much anticipated period of the year all around the
                                world. It is an important time and means many different things to everyone. It
                                is a time to reconnect with family and loved ones, a time of giving and
                                receiving gifts and love, and a time to relax and take a break from all the rigors
                                of the previous months.

                                religion. It is a time for everyone to be merry and

                                myrrh to the baby Jesus.

                                Over several days leading up to Christmas in Mexico, there are reenactments of
                                Mary and Joseph's frantic search for an inn where the baby Jesus might be
                                born. On Christmas Day, children take turns batting a piñata stuffed with
                                little toys and holiday candy.

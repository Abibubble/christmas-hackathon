        <summary> Christmas Day not on Christmas day? </summary>
        <p>
            In Eritrea, like in its neighbour Ethiopia, Christmas is celebrated on January 7th, rather than December 25th. This is because the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church uses the Geez Calendar that is somewhat similar to the Julian Calendar followed by Eastern Orthodox Church.

            A popular and ubiquitous tradition associated with Diwali is the bursting of firecrackers. However, this is a recent addition to Diwali celebrations, since until the 1900s firecrackers and pyrotechnics were very expensive and were only used by the royals.

        <summary> The Kissing Bough anyone? </summary>
        <p>
            At Yuletide, the Pagan tradition, it has often been customary to make a decoration using two hoops, one thrust through the other, bound with evergreens and colourfully decorated. At the bottom of the decoration a bunch of mistletoe is carefully tied, and the whole tableau is suspended in the middle of the room, the centre of attention. Every berry on the mistletoe bears the promise of a kiss, and for every kiss given or taken a berry is removed. When all the berries are gone, the kissing has to stop!

        <summary> Where Christmas Eve is not a very "silent night"? </summary>
        <p>
            In Haiti lots of houses are open with all lights on until about 3.00am! Children are normally allowed to go out and often the parents don't know were they are in the early morning - the older children are expected to look after the younger ones! And children of all ages are also allowed to drink 'Anisette', which is a slightly alcoholic drink that's made by soaking 'anise' leaves (the spice where star anise comes from) in rum and sweetening it with sugar.

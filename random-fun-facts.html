        <summary> Christmas Day not on Christmas day? </summary>
        <p>
            In Eritrea, like in its neighbour Ethiopia, Christmas is celebrated on January 7th, rather than December 25th. This is because the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church uses the Geez Calendar that is somewhat similar to the Julian Calendar followed by Eastern Orthodox Church.

        <summary> Where Christmas Eve is not a very "silent night"? </summary>
        <p>
            In Haiti lots of houses are open with all lights on until about 3.00am! Children are normally allowed to go out and often the parents don't know were they are in the early morning - the older children are expected to look after the younger ones! And children of all ages are also allowed to drink 'Anisette', which is a slightly alcoholic drink that's made by soaking 'anise' leaves (the spice where star anise comes from) in rum and sweetening it with sugar.

        <summary> A very romantic Christmas Eve? </summary>
        <p>
            In Japan Christmas Eve is thought of as a romantic day, in which couples spend together and exchange presents. In many ways it resembles Valentine's Day celebrations in the UK and the USA. Young couples like to go for walks to look at the Christmas lights and have a romantic meal in a restaurant.

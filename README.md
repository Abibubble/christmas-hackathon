# While We Work! (*Whistling is optional*)

Hi `Team 9`,

Thought I would write a basic doc for us as a first port of call. Any major
updates and/or changes could be added to this doc as well as the issues board
etc.

## ***Remember:***

- File naming convention is:  
  `meaningful-hyphenated-names.extension`

- Please add all attribution/credits to the README column in the project board,
  ie:  
  Header image with bright flowers - `https://someURLhere.example`
  - **We will not use images that have legal issues**...please try and use our
    own images or stock images from free resources.
  - If multiple images come from the same resource, we may be able to do a
    mass-attribution to the site as a whole but please add the info in case
    we don't do that.
  - It is a lot easier to do when you get the image than trawling through your
    history!

---

If something is really important:

## ***make it really stand out***

Really looking forward to working with you all and hope we have a great time
creating something together! Oh, I suppose if we get a good place - that is a
bonus!!

## Application/Site Idea

A resource for information on holidays around the globe, from all walks of life
and all times of the year.  Hopefully with search features, possibly a random
holiday 'generator' to encourage education and diversity.

# While We Work! (*Whistling is optional*)

Hi `Team 9`,

- Issues assigned but flexible. Hopefully everyone has something they can
  make a start on.

- File naming convention is:  
  `meaningful-hyphenated-names.extension`

- General design based on https://decemberinmadeira.madeirabelongstoall.com/en/
- Header with logo/title?
  - Menu icon for quick navigation?
  - Maintained throughout site
- Welcome page with stary night image
  - Individual stars for links to main content
  - Very short text welcome
  - Eye catching and emotive
  - Small margin below for space for down arrow/show content below fold
- Brief section for each holiday
  - Holiday related image
  - Name of holiday and very brief info
  - Button linking to main content information
  - Small margin below for space for down arrow/show content below fold

## Application/Site Idea

A resource for information on holidays around the globe, from all walks of life
and all times of the year.  Hopefully with search features, possibly a random
holiday 'generator' to encourage education and diversity.

- Please add all attribution/credits to the README column in the project board,
  ie:  
  Header image with bright flowers - `https://someURLhere.example`
  - **We will not use images that have legal issues**...please try and use our
    own images or stock images from free resources.
  - If multiple images come from the same resource, we may be able to do a
    mass-attribution to the site as a whole but please add the info in case
    we don't do that.
  - It is a lot easier to do when you get the image than trawling through your
    history!

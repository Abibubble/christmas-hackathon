# While We Work! (*Whistling is optional*)

Hi `Team 9`,

Thought I would write a basic doc for us as a first port of call. Any major
updates and/or changes could be added to this doc as well as the issues board
etc.

## ***Remember:***

- File naming convention is:  
  `meaningful-hyphenated-names.extension`

If something is really important:

## ***make it really stand out***

Really looking forward to working with you all and hope we have a great time
creating something together! Oh, I suppose if we get a good place - that is a
bonus!!

:santa:

                                <h3>What is Diwali...</h3>
                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                    Diwali or Deepawali, known as the “festival of lights,” is usually celebrated in October or November, in 2021 it”s on October 24. Lasting over five days, the holiday is celebrated by millions of Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs worldwide. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">
                                    The name of this festival is derived from “avali,” which means “row,” and “deepa,” meaning “clay lamps.” When merged, these words mean “a row of lights.” This is why lights are symbolic of this festival and Indians go overboard with sparklers and fireworks to fuel the inner light that spiritually protects them from the darkness. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="holiday-description holiday-p">

                                    The beauty of Diwali is that it is not limited to the celebration of just one historical event. Each religion remembers different stories and historical events behind it. Hindus honour the return of their religious deities Sita and Rama to Ayodhya, following an exile of 14 years. The day when Goddess Mother Durga destroyed the demon Mahisha is also celebrated.

                                    Sikhs also celebrate the release of their sixth guru, Hargobind Singh, from prison in 1619. Remarkably, the foundation stone of the holiest place for Sikhs, the Golden Temple of Amritsar, was embedded in 1577 on Diwali. For Jains, Lord Mahavira, the founder of their religion, called Jainism, reached the state of Nirvana or Moksha on the occasion of Diwali.

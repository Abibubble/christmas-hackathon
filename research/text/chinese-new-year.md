### Origin Early in Shang Dynasty (17th century BC – 1046 BC)

- The history of Chinese New Year was closely associated with agrarian society
  in old times. Ancient people concluded the disciplines of cycles of seasons
  from their planting experience, and the yearly celebration came into being
  with the outcome of calendar in the Shang Dynasty. The earliest worshiping
  activities became the embryo of the festival. People attributed their food,
  clothes and harvest to the god and ancestor’s will, so they held sacrifice
  ceremonies to pray for blessing and peace at the end of each year.

### Use of ‘Year’ in Zhou Dynasty (1046 – 256 BC)

- The name of 'Year', 'Nian' in Chinese, emerged in the Zhou Dynasty, and
  worshiping performance turned to be social practice to observe the beginning
  of farming work in spring. Not only worshiping ancestor and praying for good
  harvest, people also began to enshrine Kitchen God, Gate God, Joy God,
  Wealth God, and Well God.

### Date Fixed since Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD)

- The festival date had been finally entrenched since the Emperor Wudi of Han
  Dynasty fixed it on the first day of the first month in Chinese lunar
  calendar, which was of great significance in Chinese New Year history, for the
  date has been using for thousands of years till now. At that time, the
  festival had become a nationwide event. There was a big carnival launched by
  the government, and civil servants gathered for celebration. New activities
  also arose, such as staying up at night, burning bamboo, which is just like
  setting off fireworks nowadays, as well as hanging peach boards, which later
  became the Spring Festival couplets.

### Celebration Style from Wei & Jin to Qing Dynasty (220 - 1911 AD)

- In Wei and Jin Dynasties (220 – 439AD), the celebration was still a grand fair
  for the government, and common people would use the cracking sound of burning
  bamboo to subdue the evil spirits. Staying up tradition was also widely kept,
  and people would dress in tidy to kneel down to senior family members. The
  words Yuandan and Xinnian were created to mark the turn between two years.

  Yuanri. In the flourishing Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD), the function of
  Chinese New Year had shifted from worshiping and praying to social
  entertainment. People got public holidays for staying with family members. At
  that time, it evolved into a festival for common people to share jubilation
  indeed. With the invention of black powder in the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279
  AD), firecrackers also came into the celebration.

- From Song Dynasty to Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911 AD), the Lunar New Year had
  been named Yuandan, and the celebrations were more of social interaction.
